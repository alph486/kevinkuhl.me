For work I do DevOps and Systems Architecture stuff at [SmarterX](https://www.smarterx.com). Sometimes I consult as [MUX](mailto:kevin@mux.consulting).

I like philosophy, interactive art, ancient things, technology, the art of work, and the human condition. I write (very) short musings on these things and others in [/thoughts](https://buttondown.email/kevinkuhl). I write far less frequently and at greater length about that stuff in [/blog](/pages/blog).

I'd love to hear from you via the links below :point_down:
