# Consulting
Infrastructure, Operations, Site Reliability, and all other things DevOps are very (very) different to small companies. A vacuum exists for earlier stage companies where inexpensive tools, zero-to-one simple automation and reference architectures should be. As a result, the either cut corners or spend too much time and money.

Operational maturity is a very fluid thing, and companies are as unique as fingeprints. Relentless persuit of less, measurement, and agility are the ingredients MUX provides to smaller companies.

**Together, we create a [flywheel](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html) of data-centered and automation-driven DevOps that is poised to evolve as your company certainly will.**
