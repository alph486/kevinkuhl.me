# About
Infrastructure, Operations, Site Reliability, and all other things DevOps are very (very) different to small companies. Yet, there is a clear lack of inexpensive, simple tooling and reference architectures for smaller organizations. As a result, the either cut corners or spend too much time and money.

Operational complexity is a very fluid thing and companies are in unique stages of need. **Relentless persuit of less, measurement, and agility are the ingredients MUX provides to smaller companies.**

Together, we create a [flywheel](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html) of data and automation-driven DevOps at a weight ans size appropriate for your organization.

If that sounds like something you need, [contact me](mailto:mux@kuhl.mozmail.com)! I'd love to work with you :blue_heart:.
