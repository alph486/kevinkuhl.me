Working outside just now I noticed how the [winter sun is different](https://journeynorth.org/tm/mclass/ReasonsBack.html) somehow. It reminded me a lot of the titular [Emily Dickinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson) poem I read several winters ago which stuck. The [analysis](https://www.litcharts.com/poetry/emily-dickinson/there-s-a-certain-slant-of-light) is interesting. Just the diffusion of light can stir us.

> There's a certain Slant of light,  
Winter Afternoons –  
That oppresses, like the Heft  
Of Cathedral Tunes –  
Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –  
We can find no scar,  
But internal difference,  
Where the Meanings, are –  
None may teach it – Any –  
'Tis the Seal Despair –  
An imperial affliction  
Sent us of the Air –  
When it comes, the Landscape listens –  
Shadows – hold their breath –  
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance  
On the look of Death –
