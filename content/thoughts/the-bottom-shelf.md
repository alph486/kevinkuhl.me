The crowded library presents an intriguing social experiment. Most people gravitate towards the easily accessible top shelves, neglecting the hard to get to bottom one; I mean you pretty much have to lay on the floor to search it. I did this with my son not long ago (not because I wanted to) and got 23 really good books when all the other shelves were ransacked.

Surely there are some “bottom shelves” in your world that people ignore because of a minor inconvenience. What kind of gems will you find if you go inconvenience yourself a bit?
