Scholars [seem to think](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/talent) talent is innate. But that's weird, right? It doesn't matter how I am talented; I either am or I am not. Another common angle is the *Dad Speech*:

> Well if you practice every day you'll get better at this.

This is the ever-encouraging *"you're bad and I know you don't feel good so you should feel this way every day until you are good.*..

I saw this clip of a well-known [clip of Bob Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mInAfjwGznE) recently. While addressing his art vs. the viewer's he says:

> “Talent is a pursued interest. Anything that you're willing to practice, you can do.”

Bob's is not only more correct than Webster's but also blameless and a longer view than Dad's.
