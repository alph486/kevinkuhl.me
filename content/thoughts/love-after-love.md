From an [article](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/04/21/love-after-love-derek-walcott/) by [Maria Popova](https://twitter.com/brainpicker) @ [The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/), which I recommend. This has something happy and mournful about it:

> **LOVE AFTER LOVE**  
_by Derek Walcott_

>The time will come  
when, with elation,  
you will greet yourself arriving  
at your own door, in your own mirror,  
and each will smile at the otherâ€™s welcome,  
and say, sit here. Eat.  
You will love again the stranger who was your self.  
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart  
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you  
all your life, whom you ignored  
for another, who knows you by heart.  
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,  
the photographs, the desperate notes,  
peel your own image from the mirror.  
Sit. Feast on your life.
