# A Case for Tiny Newsletters

When I read something online, I don't often get to the important parts. I think I've benefited most from [short](https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-perfect-conditions/), open-ended thoughts dusted lightly with hyperlinks.

Here I challenge myself to write musings about things that inspire me using simple tech in few words. I think this is the best way to share a concept and to let it germinate into something somewhere else. My one and only guarantee: I won't email more than daily.

If you [subscribe](https://buttondown.email/kevinkuhl), reply with your thoughts if it provokes something. I'd love to hear it!
