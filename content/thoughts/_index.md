# A Case for Tiny Newsletters

When I read something online, I don't often get to the important parts. I'm usually frantically deleting email while getting in the shower or something. In fact, I think I've benefited most from short, partly complete thoughts with a dusting of hyperlinks. Social media forms of microblogging come with too many distractions. [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com) and others aren't quite there yet. 

A short thought on the back of [Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_email) and [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS#History), the bedrock of the internet, just sounded refreshing :relieved:. 

In *Thoughts* I challenge myself to write lo-fi musings about thinkg I like in as few words as makes sense so people can digest it and think about it too.

My one and only guarantee: I won't email more than daily.

If you [subscribe](https://buttondown.email/kevinkuhl), reply with your thoughts if it provokes something. I'd love to hear it!
