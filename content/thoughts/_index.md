# A Case for Tiny Newsletters

When I read something online, I don't often get to the important parts. I'm usually frantically deleting email while getting in the shower or something. I think I've benefited most from [short](https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-perfect-conditions/), open-ended thoughts dusted lightly with hyperlinks. Social media microblogging come with too many distractions. [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com) and [others](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/) are cool but have growth to do. Email and RSS sound right.

In *Thoughts* I challenge myself to write lo-fi musings about things that inspire me in as few words as I can. I think this is the best way to share a concept and to let it germinate into something somewhere else.

My one and only guarantee: I won't email more than daily.

If you [subscribe](https://buttondown.email/kevinkuhl), reply with your thoughts if it provokes something. I'd love to hear it!
