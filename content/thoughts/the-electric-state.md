> Lighthouse keepers were once warned they shouldn’t listen to the sea for too long. You could lose your mind and hear voices in the static.  
> As if there was a code in there—a code that could, as soon as your mind detected it, irrevocably conjure demons from the depths.

[The Electric State](https://www.simonstalenhag.se/es.html) is 90% art 10% textual fiction about humanity's relationship with technology. It was turned into a [show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7766378/) at some point. It's [melancholic and chilling and weird.](https://www.redbubble.com/i/photographic-print/Midnight-Upload-by-simonstalenhag/41054189.ZRLK5) The art places me in a setting [fantastical](https://www.redbubble.com/i/photographic-print/Incident-On-The-Edge-Of-Town-by-simonstalenhag/22450837.ZRLK5) enough that I can't help but want to explore it. [Stålenhag](https://www.simonstalenhag.se/) has released a source book for a game based on the book which I'm excited about. If this sounds interesting to you should definitely [check it out](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/the-electric-state-roleplaying-game).
