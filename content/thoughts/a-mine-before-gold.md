We crave machinery because it's order incarnate: it is well defined and it the thing it makes is well defined. There's no mess. But sometimes we have to make a mess first. When we're starting a project we must ask ourselves: Should the energy be to build the mine, or to search for gold.

And by the way, it's just as bad to ignore machinery as it is to build it too early. **In fact, maybe all startup/growth phases is about is knowing when (not) to build the mine**
