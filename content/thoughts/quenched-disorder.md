Millions of years ago a staggeringly complex system (post-ice-age Earth) began warming.

After a very long time, probabilities collapsed: continents and oceans formed at random locations on our planet.

Then, time: Biology... Civilization...

[Quenched Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_and_disorder#Quenched_disorder) is a concept in physics whereby properties of a system are randomly generated and then frozen. The system now works with (or against) them. I love this because it's grounded in natural law and *so fundamentally human*. We see this every day and complain about it, yet it's a fundamental law of our universe.

Disorder and chaos are unavoidable conjurations of the universe itself. Observing [the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) that grows and adapts to those ethereal constraints is the most tangible form of magic: watching a child grow, a career unfold, a community come together (or become divided).
