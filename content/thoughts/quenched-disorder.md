Millions of years ago a staggeringly complex system (post ice-age Earth) set about warming. After a very long time, probabilities collapsed. Continents and oceans formed at what were once entirely random locations on our planet.

Then, time...

[Quenched Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_and_disorder#Quenched_disorder) is a physics concept whereby properties of a system are randomly generated and then frozen. The moving system now works with (or against) them. I love this because its grounded in natural law and _so_ fundamentally human.

Seeds of disorder and chaos are unavoidable conjurations of the universe itself. Observing (or participating in) [the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) that grows and adapts to those ethereal constraints is the most tangible form of magic.
