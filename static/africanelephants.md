# What Are African Elephants?

- Largest land animals on Earth
- Two species:
  - **Savannah Elephant** (*Loxodonta africana*)
  - **Forest Elephant** (*Loxodonta cyclotis*)
- Known for:
  - Massive ears (help regulate body temperature)
  - Long trunks (used for communication, feeding, drinking)
  - Social and intelligent behaviors

---

# Where Do They Live?

- **Savannah Elephants**:
  - Found across sub-Saharan Africa
  - Prefer open grasslands and woodlands
- **Forest Elephants**:
  - Inhabit dense rainforests of Central and West Africa
  - Smaller and more elusive

> Together, they shape entire ecosystems.

# Social Life of Elephants

- Live in **matriarchal family groups**
- Led by the oldest, most experienced female
- Strong social bonds
- Communicate through:
  - Vocalizations (rumbles, trumpets)
  - Body language
  - Seismic signals (detectable through the ground)

# Diet and Ecosystem Impact

- Herbivores → eat grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark
- Consume up to 300 lbs of food daily
- Known as **"ecosystem engineers"**:
  - Create water holes
  - Disperse seeds
  - Shape landscapes

> Their presence benefits countless other species.

---

# Threats to African Elephants

- **Poaching** for ivory (biggest historical threat)
- **Habitat loss and fragmentation**
- **Human-wildlife conflict**
- **Climate change impacts**

> Populations have declined significantly in the past century.

---

# Conservation Efforts

- International ivory trade bans
- Protected reserves and national parks
- Anti-poaching patrols and technology
- Community-based conservation initiatives

> Positive trends in some regions, but challenges remain.

# Why Protect Elephants?

- Keystone species → vital to ecosystem health
- Cultural and economic significance
- Ethical responsibility to prevent extinction

> Protecting elephants protects entire ecosystems.
